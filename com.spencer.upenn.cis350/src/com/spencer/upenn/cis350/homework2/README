Please note that some of these tests will pass with the unimplemented version of the 
GPXcalculator.calculateDistanceTraveled(GPXtrk trk) method. This is because it these
tests (the 'advanced' series) generate random points for testing, and compare a distance
calculated before versus distance after a particular test point is added. These tests should
be taken in context with all the other JUnit tests developed, and not on their own. These tests
look for advanced functionality in the method and should only be considered after basic and standard
tests pass.
